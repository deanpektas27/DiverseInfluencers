                            Fellows participate in 16 workshops to learn soft and hard skills through interactive activities and assignments. 
                            Some of the topics we cover with fellows include the following: public speaking, teamwork, 
                            leadership, problem solving, Excel, and JavaScript.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Fellows also complete a semester-long group assignment called “Project Synergy." 
                            The group assignment allows fellows to utilize the soft and hard skills they have 
                            learned to create a mock business. Each group will then conduct a presentation on 
                            their mock business in front of a panel of judges.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            To wrap up the program, fellows participate in 2 workshops titled, “Career Conversations." 
                            Fellows will get more in-depth information on potential career paths in both business and 
                            technology to help solidify their career goals.

                        In addition to workshops, each fellow is paired with a volunteer mentor to receive one-on-one career guidance. 
                        Mentors serve as the “ultimate life hack” for fellows to learn from and build a lasting relationship with.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Mentors help Fellows develop SMART* goals to complete during and after the program. 
                        Fellows meet with their mentors once a month to discuss progression towards completing their 
                        SMART goals and receive career advice.

                  <p>Fellows will be taught how to improve their soft and hard skills, 
                    as well as gain a better understanding of what career paths to pursue. 
                    We also have a hackathon-type project fellows will work on called, Project Synergy. 
                    Fellows will develop a product/company, while integrating the hard skills taught to them through our workshops.
