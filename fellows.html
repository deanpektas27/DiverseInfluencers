                      <p><br>Ever since I can remember, I have always considered myself as an adventurer on the hunt
                        for treasure. I take on every opportunity I earn with the same initiative. I think that with
                        every new adventurous opportunity, I am getting closer and closer to reaching treasure.
                        Whether that treasure is gaining knowledge, experience, or new skillsets, I recognize that with
                        every new opportunity comes growth. It is for this reason that I joined Diverse Influencers as a
                        Business Fellow.<br>

                        Specific career fields I am interested in, I do know that I want to combine my knowledge of film and business into one area of study. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, and trying different types of cuisine around New York City.

                      <p><br>As a first-generation college student growing up in a Hispanic household, I am motivated to provide a better life for my family. 
                          I knew I had to take initiative by furthering my education and gaining more insight on a career in finance. 
                          It is crucial to have a small network of friends/family to strive and better yourself and others along the way. 
                          For these reasons, I joined Diverse Influencers as a Business Fellow.<br>

                        I will be looking to expand my knowledge of business-related topics such as financial analysis, accounting, 
                        stock trading and much more. In my free time, I enjoy learning more about history, watching documentaries/movies and 
                        learning more about cinema (particularly action related or superhero films).

                            Growing up, I was destined to be another statistic. but this past year I broke that stigma. 
                            As a Hispanic woman, I find it essential to break these stigmas for future generations to come, 
                            which is why I joined Diverse Influencers as a Business Fellow.<br>
                            <br>
                            Currently, I am a freshman at Hunter College with intent to double major in Chinese 
                            and Economics/International Business. Although I am still not fully confident in what my 
                            future career lies in, I hope the next four years will allow me to find my true calling. 
                            Along with being part of Diverse Influencers, I am an ambassador for an organization 
                            off-campus called LetHerLearn. Outside of my academics, I enjoy playing basketball and volleyball, 
                            owning a small Etsy shop, as well as creating music on my keyboard.

                            I was born in America but lived in China for six years with my grandparents while my parents worked in America. 
                            When I moved back to America, I knew no English and felt completely lost and hopeless. Luckily, I always had my 
                            parents there to support and encourage me. They are my motivation to succeed as I hope to one day give back and 
                            allow them to retire as soon as possible. Professional development is important to me because I believe that there’s 
                            always room for personal growth. In addition, with a good support system and positive attitude, anything is possible. 
                            I am in Diverse Influencers because I want to be in a community where I am surrounded by people who are also driven to succeed.<br>

                            I am currently a sophomore majoring in Finance at Baruch College. In addition to DI, I enjoy being involved on campus. I am part of the Collegiate Association of Women in Business, Conversation Partners Program, Vietnamese Student Association, and am continuously looking to join more organizations. I have also worked as a barista for three years, so I know how to make different types of coffee art. In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors whether it’s running, biking, or exploring the city looking for new adventures.

                        <p><br>As a first-generation Hispanic college student, I am motivated to take down barriers that try to prevent me from reaching my goals. 
                            I want my family to learn that even though I may not hold any interests to become a lawyer or a doctor, 
                            I can still be successful despite the challenges that we are experiencing today. Therefore, 
                            I am always trying to be involved in programs that are closely related to my career-interests and taking advantage of opportunities 
                            that are presented in order to expand my knowledge and skills that will benefit me in the future. Hence, I believe that joining 
                            Diverse Influencers as a Technology Fellow is a wise choice on my part as I am interested in developing my skills that I can use for my career.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently a freshman at Hunter College, majoring in Political Science and considering minoring in International Relations. 
                            Even though I am not certain whether or not the opportunities I pursue will secure my career as an Intelligence Analyst, 
                            I am still grateful for the benefits I obtain from being part of the programs I have taken part in. Off campus, 
                            I have been helping my mother after school with bottle picking twice a week to have extra money to support us throughout the pandemic. 
                            As for my outside interests and hobbies, I enjoy watching Netflix, listening to music, and drawing random shapes and lines to distract 
                            myself from my academics and provide a moment of peace whenever I feel stress or anxious.

                        <p><br>I am a first-generation college student. My parents came to the United States from China. 
                            They have both sacrificed a lot and work hard every day to support our family. They raised me to be who I am, and 
                            I couldn’t be more thankful and proud of that. My parents are my biggest motivation. I want to make them proud by 
                            working towards a stable career, so they can take a step back to relax. I am driven to succeed and accomplish my goals 
                            through challenges that I will face throughout my journey, because at the end of the day it will be worth it. 
                            To do that, I always think positive and believe in myself – to trust the process. This is the reason why I 
                            wanted to join Diverse Influencers as a Business Fellow. Learning through workshops, completing projects, enhancing skills, 
                            and having a mentor and other people that I will meet here to support and guide me is what attracted me to the organization.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently a sophomore at Brooklyn College planning to major in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. 
                            When I first entered college, I thought of majoring in Education because I enjoy working with kids. Previously, I was a counselor 
                            for students at a public-school during afterschool and summer for 3 years. As much as I loved working with kids, I realized that 
                            being a teacher is not what I wanted to pursue. That is when I decided that a job in the business field is what I wanted to go for. 
                            I love interacting and working together with people, thinking creatively, solving problems, and analyzing data. I took a couple of 
                            business courses to see which one interested me the most. The moment I took marketing class, it intrigued me enough to fully pursue it. 
                            However, I am open to other opportunities because this I always seek to learn new skills. Aside from school and work, I like to hang out 
                            with my friends and family, travel, do outdoor activities, play volleyball, and watch Netflix.

                            Working on skills that will improve my career development, professional network, and leadership roles is essential for me to become successful. 
                            For that reason, I became interested in Diverse Influencers and joined as a Business Fellow.<br>

                            I am currently a freshman at Borough of Manhattan Community College. Although I am a Liberal Arts major, my main interest 
                            lies on being a beauty entrepreneur. In addition to DI, I want to use my time to complete internships, specifically with startups. 
                            Being able to learn from other successful entrepreneurs and their story is something I look forward to. I also currently work 
                            part-time as a barista. In my free time, I like to make D.I.Ys.

                            I come from a low-income background, so I’m also not very familiar with how to best present myself professionally.

                            part of an environment of endless learning. Nowadays, it’s not necessarily about what you know, but whom you know. 
                            So, I’m excited to make amazing friends with my peers and build meaningful connections with my mentors.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently a freshman at Baruch College interested in pursuing Human Resources Management. 
                            The business field is multi-faceted, so there are so many other sub-fields I also want to study. 
                            I am also interested in Operations Management and Finance. On campus, I am part of the accelerator program at ALPFA Baruch, 
                            where I am learning about the technical aspects of a career in finance and how to hone my professional skills. 
                            Along with school, I am also a program evaluation intern at Metis Associates, a research consulting firm. 
                            During my free time, I love to experiment with cooking different cuisines and following the world of K-pop.

                            I knew that the cards were stacked against me in terms of career development. I feel that it is important for

                            that may seem too challenging. It’s important to stay persistent and have a determined attitude, as well as keeping

                            Currently, I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity with intended minors 
                            in Mathematics and Data Analytics at Baruch College. In the future, I hope to land a job in Risk Management, Risk Consulting, 
                            or serve as a Technology Analyst. As well as being a Technology Fellow at Diverse Influencers, I am also involved in 
                            extracurricular activities on campus, currently serving as Assistant Secretary at the ISACA Cybersecurity Club. 
                            While juggling all of these responsibilities in my life, I am also working part-time at CVS Health as a Sales Colleague,

                            careers, especially tech wise, and knowing that I am one of the reasons that it is decreasing is
                            another great goal of mine that always keeps me striving. This was also the reason why I joined

                            was always set on my major since I was a freshman, however I am unsure about my career 
                            position in the future. I am considering becoming a Software Engineer or maybe something with 
                            FinTech, but I am unsure. I recently had a position with Upperline Code as a Teaching Assistant 
                            for several of their summer CS classes for incoming freshmen. As a result, I strengthened my CS skills, 
                            as well as some of my soft skills. I also recently got accepted for a Winternship and will be interning 
                            for a tech related company soon. In my free time, I look after my little sister and watch Netflix and TikTok.

                        <p><br>My name is Alexandria Parkes. I was born in the East Bronx. A few months ago, 
                            I was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus that caused me to develop class IV Lupus Nephritis. 
                            Being diagnosed with a chronic illness of this degree at such a young age made me question whether or not it was 
                            still possible for me to reach the level of success that I desired. After coming to terms with my disease, 
                            I decided not to give up and let it control my life. That’s why it’s imperative that I work as hard as I can 
                            now and invest my time and effort into doing things that will aid in my professional growth and help me to reach all my life goals. 
                            Being involved in Diverse Influencers as a Business Fellow will assist not only in my professional growth, but in my personal growth as well. 
                            It’ll help strengthen my interpersonal, leadership, and public speaking skills. All things that are necessary in order to reach my full potential.<br>
                            <br>
                            I’m currently an Undecided freshman at Lehman College. Even though I have yet to declare my major, I’m taking classes under a Business Administration track since that’s currently the field
                            that piques my interest and I feel will suit me best. I thoroughly enjoy planning every single
                            aspect of my life, even the things that haven’t happened yet. I make vision boards and have
                            recently started working on a “vision notebook” that I can take with me anywhere I go. Everything from my next meal, all the way down to where I see myself in the next 10 years gets written down. Even though not everything always goes as planned, I don’t get discouraged. I
                            adjust, then re-plan over and over again.

                        <p><br>Early in life, I was exuberant and attracted those who fed off that energy. More often than not
                            however, people compounded this trait with ignorance, and I was perceived as the “village idiot” of sorts. 
                            I yielded to having this flat character be my profile until the latter half of my high school years when I met 
                            adults who associated with me and then started embracing ideas and opinions I had, much more so than I did. 
                            Henceforth, I craved knowledge to empower and to become the genius that those adjacent already saw. 
                            My pursuit for intellectual growth encourages me to thrive from experiences, in turn aiding my professional growth. 
                            To be among likeminded peers and for the privilege of having mentors who will assist and bestow faith in me are reasons 
                            I joined Diverse Influencers as a Business Fellow.<br>
                            <br>
                            As a freshman at Hunter College, it is difficult to foresee the major I would declare. 
                            The current candidates are English and Economics. On campus, I am enlisting in a fraternity called Kappa Sigma and 
                            in addition to my loyalty to DI, I am a member of clubs at Hunter such as InterVarsity, the Caribbean Student Union, 
                            and Black Male Initiative. Hobbies of mine include playing badminton, journaling and watching western and Japanese cartoons.

                        <p><br>Growing up in Washington Heights/Inwood, it was such a tight-knit community. I am fully Ecuadorian but never being surrounded 
                            by any Ecuadorians was hard. I never understood my culture and have only identified as being American. This became a great 
                            motivator for me because a lot of people who are not cultured feel as if we should not belong in America though it is all 
                            we grew up to know. This causes me to work much harder and to succeed to prove others wrong. I joined Diverse Influencers as 
                            a Business Fellow because the community of people I have met here influences me to become more confident of where I’m from, 
                            even if I don’t understand much of my own personal culture.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently enrolled in Lehman College as a freshman. I hope to continue on my path
                            in Nursing and have carried a 3.5 - 4.0 GPA throughout all of high school. Alongside Diverse
                            Influencers, I volunteer in schools by helping families/children. I consider this to be a passion of mines. Lastly, 
                            I enjoy traveling, have a love for science, and hope to create a great name for myself in the future.

                            I feel it’s my responsibility to show them that their tireless efforts amounted to something. To meet those goals, I’ve adopted a new mindset to live by.

                        <p><br>Being raised with electronics, I’ve developed the passion for the hardware and software which allows me to access the internet. 
                            Knowing that this is also a viable career path, looking for opportunities such as Diverse Influencers is my current goal. 
                            It’s a godsend that DI is willing to help me with exactly what I want to improve on. This is why I joined the organization as a Technology Fellow.<br>
                            <br>
                            Currently, I am attending Baruch College, majoring in Computer Information Systems, and looking for a career path in that exact field. 
                            Junior year and senior year of high school, I’ve studied for Networking certifications, and have gained the CCENT. I aim to achieve the 
                            CCNA certification, however, I am unsure whether I want to continue with this path or diverge into coding. Both of these are passions of mine, 
                            and I continue to improve myself in both fields. Besides my education, I enjoy playing video games, mostly single player, while talking to my 
                            friends in voice chats on Discord.

                        <h5>Marketing at Baruch College, Class of 2024</h5>
                        <p><br>I am a second-Asian American; my mother started her college education a few years ago
                            while I was in high school. Because of this, I strive for an education that offers me the
                            opportunity to achieve academic excellence with the least amount of financial burden. 
                            Thus, my taking the adequate time to invest in my professional journey is an integral part of career
                            development. Joining Diverse Influencers as a Business Fellow is the first step towards progress in my 
                            endeavors—it will help me build a concrete foundation as I explore various opportunities pertaining to 
                            my particular field of interest: marketing.<br>
                            <br>                            
                            As a freshman at the Macaulay Honors College at Baruch College, I intend to major in Marketing Management with a concentration in Marketing Analytics. However, I keep an open mind to other available concentrations in the field of marketing. Through Diverse Influencers, I anticipate exploring new career opportunities that combine Marketing and Technology, as I have learned quite a few programming languages in high school. Apart from DI, I am training to
                            become a marketer at Spoon University—an all-things-food club at Macaulay—and exploring
                            what Women in Business at Baruch and Macaulay Business Club have to offer. At my leisure, I
                            like to run, play lacrosse with friends, do Pilates, and learn classical pieces on the piano.

                        <p><br>As an immigrant, I have learned from the start to value education as a means to “make it in America.” It is for that reason

                            Currently, I am a sophomore at Hunter College double majoring in Economics and Statistics with a minor in Mathematics. 
                            I am looking forward to getting into a career in Investment Banking or Equity Research after college. Outside of school, 
                            I intern at a marketing company, Optilytics Media, and a not-for-profit organization, Shoqata Peja. As for my free time, 
                            I enjoy shopping for unique clothing pieces and keeping up with the fashion industry. Like many, I am also an avid watcher 
                            of TikTok and ‘dabble’ in creating my own videos.
